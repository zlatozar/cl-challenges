### Guideline

**When the description of a problem gets this complicated, it is a good idea to**
**attempt a more formal specification.**

**Principles for making difficult tasks simple ones:**

1.	Use both knowledge in the world and in the head
2.	Simplify the structure of tasks
3.	Make things visible
4.	Get the mappings right
5.	Exploit the powers of constraints - Natural and Artificial
6.	Design for Error
7.	When all else fails, standardize
